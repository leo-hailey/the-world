            <h2>Over 100 oceanic species discovered</h2>
            <p>In January 2024, a team of scientists embarked on the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s research vessel Falkor (too) to investigate underwater mountain ranges off the coast of Chile. Led by Dr. Javier Sellanes from the Universidad Católica del Norte, the researchers aimed to study the biodiversity of these largely unexplored seamounts. Within less than a month, the expedition recorded 100 newly discovered deep-sea species, including various types of deep-sea corals, glass sponges, and squat lobsters. <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/underwater-mountains-harbor-abundant-life/" id="article" target="_blank"> Read more! </a> </p>

            <h2>The Earths core is slowing down</h2>
            <p>Recent research confirms that the core of our planet has been rotating unusually slowly for the past 14 years. If this mysterious trend persists, it could potentially extend the length of Earth's days, although the changes would probably be imperceptible to us. <br> The effects of this change in the inner core’s movement on Earth's surface are purely speculative.</p>
